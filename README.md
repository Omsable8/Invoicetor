**Invoicetor** 

## Tech Stack:
* Python libraries - Tkinter,Pillow (For GUI), mysql (for database connection)
* MYSQL database server

## Pre-requisites:

* MYSQL database server with database "billing_products" with no password.

- All the tables/bills will be added to this database and you can review them accordingly.
* Alternatively you can change the source code provided in the "invoicetor_src" folder and connect to your own database. All the operations and GUI will remain the same.

## Description:
This is my first project with GUI that I made in 12th grade. There are bugs in this like if you insert values in a non-existent table it throws an error. 
I also wanted to add a seperate button to convert a table/bill to a pdf in order to print it. There is alot of improvement to be done on this but nonetheless it works 
for simple insertion, deletion,updation and table creation. 

Thank you for checking out my app :)
