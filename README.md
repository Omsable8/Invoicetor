# Invoicetor
I made this project in my 12th grade and it is my very first fully fledged project.

This is a project made to create invoices/bills in a database. Its GUI is built in python using tkinter and pillow library as well as mysql.connector library to connect and interact with mysql database in python.


To use this app, please download the zip file "invoicetor". 
Before running the invoicetor.exe file, first connect to a mysql server(with no password) and create a new database called "billing_products" and only then will the app run.
Every bill/table will be added to this database and you can view them accordingly.

#OR 
you can change the source code provided in the "invoicetor_src" folder and make changes according to your database(root,password,database name,etc), the GUI and other operations will work the same.

Tips for using the app:
While creating a new table do not leave the table name blank.
Do not insert values into a table that has not been created or do not enter the wrong table name. 
While inserting values into table do not leave any of the feilds blank.
Read the comments/text box in the app to resolve any error.


Thank you for checking out my app :)
